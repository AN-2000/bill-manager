open page => company profile load old or add new 
Inside that add the other person details 
then add product details and generate bill(give option of different bill formats)
option to preview and download bill, also all bills are stored in a company profile 

if suppose person was filling a bill and go back to select company the details are still in session so autofill the already saved details 
we have 2 columns in billing, cgst and sgst if one is filled other should update with itself
Entering item quantity and price and gst should update the amount value everywhere in its column as well as in total

Bill refresh krne pr ek bug h itemid = 1 hojata h but saved data me nhi hoga aisa to jha saved data check kr rhe h wha item id nikalkr update bhi krdete hai
